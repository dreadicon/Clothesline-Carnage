Creating a new level:
First, ensure that your project is up to date with the GitHub client. (sync changes and update to latest, resolving any conflicts) Then open the project in Unity.
Second, create a new folder in the Assets -> Level folder, with the name of the level you are making. Put your foreground, background, and any other images or assets in that folder.
Third, create a new scene, saving the scene file inside your newly created folder, and then drag the 'LevelManager' prefab into your heirarchy box to create an instance of it.
Finally, drag your Foreground image into the sprite field of the Foreground object under the LevelManager in the scene, and then click the gear icon of the Foreground object's Polygon Collider 2D, and select 'Reset' to generate the collision mesh. Now also drag the background image into the sprite field of the Background object, also located under the LevelManager.

Your level now has the basics set up!

To make separate platroms, just drop the LevelObstacle into the heirarchy, placing it under the LevelManager, and as you did for the foreground set a sprite, then reset the polygon collider. Now you can position it as you like!

You can also edit the polygon colliders that are auto-generated by clicking the 'edit collider' button in the polygon collider component.

To add a spawnpoint, create a new empty object, put it under the LevelManager, and tag it with "Respawn". (Note: these will not work now, but will work soon)

Once you are done with the level (or are done working on it for the moment), please follow the following steps:
First, ensure your project is up to date with any changes made to GitHub (sync changes and update to latest, resolving any conflicts). Then 'commit' your changes, filling out the summary and description fields, then press 'Commit'.
Second, sync your local github.

And that's it!
